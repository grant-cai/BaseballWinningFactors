# Winning Factors in Baseball Data Exploration

## Description

### Background

Baseball is not only one of the oldest professional sports played in the United States, 
but also one of the sports that has become increasingly interested in statistics over the 
years. As the technological means have developed over the decades, the sport has adopted them 
to gather more and more data about the game. What started off with simple tallying and
tracking by individuals is now a sport with high-framerate cameras and radar guns. This
collection of data has all served the core purpose of allowing teams to extrapolate useful
information in order to win ball games. 

### Goal

The purpose of this project was to conduct a data exploration into some of the very basic
metrics that occur during a baseball game using various types of statistical modeling
in order to determine which factors most heavily influenced a team's ability to win a game 
or not.

While it makes intuitive sense that the team that gets the most hits and avoids letting
opponents on base will have a greater chance of winning the game, we hoped that our data
analysis would yield more insightful results into other events that take place during the
game that might influence a team's ability to win.
